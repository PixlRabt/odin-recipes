This repository contains my first attempt at a basic html website for the Odin Project. 

The website is a basic cooking recipes website, and demonstrates the following technical skills;
- Implementation of a basic HTML boilerplate for each page
- Management of multiple pages with correct links and in-repository organisation
- Image sourcing
- Basic formatting, efficient and appropriate use of heading elements and unordered list elements
- Some basic CSS for image positioning/scaling, and column formatting. Superfluous for the purpose of the assignment.
