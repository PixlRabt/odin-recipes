                <h4>Step 1</h4>
                <p>Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic 
                    and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until onion softens. Add the mince and cook, 
                    stirring with a wooden spoon to break up any lumps, for 5 minutes or until mince 
                    changes colour. Add the tomato , wine and tomato paste , and bring to the boil. 
                    Reduce heat to low. Simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes or

                    pepper.

                <h4>Step 2</h4>

                    peppercorns , cloves and bay leaves in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over 
                    medium heat. Remove from heat and set aside for 15 minutes to infuse.

                <h4>Step 4</h4>

                    oil to lightly grease. Spread one-quarter of the bechamel sauce over the base of the 
                    prepared dish. Arrange 1 lasagne sheet over the sauce. Top with one-third of the 
                    mince mixture and one-third of the remaining bechamel sauce. Continue layering with 
                    the remaining lasagne sheets, mince mixture and bechamel, finishing with a layer of 
                    bechamel. Sprinkle with mozzarella . Place on a baking tray. Bake in preheated oven 
                    for 40 minutes or until cheese melts, is golden brown, and the edges are bubbling.
