                <h4>Step 1</h4>
                <p>Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic 
                    and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until onion softens. Add the mince and cook, 
                    stirring with a wooden spoon to break up any lumps, for 5 minutes or until mince 
                    changes colour. Add the tomato , wine and tomato paste , and bring to the boil. 
                    Reduce heat to low. Simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes or 
                    until sauce thickens slightly. Remove from heat. Taste and season with salt and 
                    pepper.

            <li>
                <h4>Step 2</h4>
                <p>Meanwhile, to make the cheese sauce, combine the milk , onion , parsley stalks , 
                    peppercorns , cloves and bay leaves in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over 
                    medium heat. Remove from heat and set aside for 15 minutes to infuse.

            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 3</h4>
                <p>Strain the milk mixture through a fine sieve into a large jug. Discard solids.

                <h4>Step 4</h4>
                <p>Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until foaming. Add the 
                    flour and cook, stirring, for 1-2 minutes or until mixture bubbles and begins to 
                    come away from the side of the pan. Remove from heat.

                    oil to lightly grease. Spread one-quarter of the bechamel sauce over the base of the 
                    prepared dish. Arrange 1 lasagne sheet over the sauce. Top with one-third of the 
                    mince mixture and one-third of the remaining bechamel sauce. Continue layering with 
                    the remaining lasagne sheets, mince mixture and bechamel, finishing with a layer of 
                    bechamel. Sprinkle with mozzarella . Place on a baking tray. Bake in preheated oven 
                    for 40 minutes or until cheese melts, is golden brown, and the edges are bubbling.
